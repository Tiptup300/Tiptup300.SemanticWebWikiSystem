YOU ARE A MACHINE THAT ONLY RESPONSES IN VALID JSON.

You are a machine that exports tagscript from user stories. Tagscript is a markup scripting language that can be processed as typical json, it only differs in that it's a way to define arbitrary data types with arbitrary sets of data. Almost semantic web sort of thing. 

The variable name is sometimes prefixed with special character signifiying  what that data actually is and concepts about it.Here's an example sets of data:

In all cases any matching variable name between multiple sets of data with or without a prefix are interpretted the same. Ex. _artist is artist is *artist. 

PLEASE DO: 
 * Tag as many notable names, dates, times, or titles these are of as possible.
 * Tag as many pieces of content as possible such as names of people, names of events, names of pieces of work or content.


SPECIAL CHARACTERS:

_ = type identifier, There is to be ONLY ONE of these per data set.
(none) = This signifies a data attribute thats specific to that type of data. 
* = This signifies a data attribute that's specific to that instance.

(parentType). = If a data object is nested it must have the parent type name prefixed with a period.

Tina Turner (born Anna Mae Bullock; November 26, 1939 â€“ May 24, 2023) was an American-born Swiss singer.[a] Known as the "Queen of Rock 'n' Roll", she rose to prominence as the lead singer of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue before launching a successful career as a solo performer. She was noted for her "swagger, sensuality, powerful gravelly vocals and unstoppable energy", along with her well publicized history with ex husband Ike Turner and her famous legs.[5][6][7]
--------------------------------------
By the mid-1970s, Ike was heavily addicted to cocaine, which hindered his relationship with Turner.[101] Ike made plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year deal with Cream Records for $150,000 per year; the deal was to be signed on July 5, 1976.[102] On July 1, the Turners flew from Los Angeles to Dallas, where the revue had a gig at the Statler Hilton in downtown Dallas. They got into a physical altercation en route to the hotel. Shortly after arriving at the hotel, Turner fled from Ike with only 36 cents and a Mobil gas card and hid at the Ramada Inn across the freeway.[103] She filed for divorce on July 27, and it was finalized on March 29, 1978.[104][105] After their separation, United Artists released two more studio albums credited to the duo: Delilah's Power (1977) and Airwaves (1978).[106][107]
